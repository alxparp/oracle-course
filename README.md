Welcome to the repository for my Oracle Databases course homework! In this repository, you will find a collection of assignments, code examples, and resources related to various topics covered in the course.

## Topics Covered

Throughout the course, I've explored and worked on the following key topics:

* Data Definition Language (DDL): Creating, altering, and managing database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.
* Data Manipulation Language (DML): Performing operations on the data stored in the database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records.
* Aggregation Functions: Using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and MAX/MIN to perform calculations on sets of data.
* Data Query Language (DQL): Retrieving specific information from the database using SELECT statements.
* Views: Creating virtual tables that display a subset of data from one or more tables.
* Configuration: Configuring and fine-tuning the database parameters for optimal performance.
* Nested Queries: Writing complex queries that involve subqueries for more advanced data retrieval.
